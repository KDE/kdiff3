<chapter id="introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
<sect1 id="why"><title>Yet Another Diff Frontend?</title>
<para>
Several graphical diff tools exist. Why choose &kdiff3;? Let me say, why I wrote it.
</para><para>
&kdiff3; started because I had to do a difficult merge. Merging is necessary when several
people work on the same files in a project. A merge can be somewhat automated, when the
merge-tool not only has the new modified files (called "branches"), but also the original file
(called "base"). The merge tool will automatically choose any modification that was only
done in one branch. When several contributors change the same lines, then the merge tool
detects a conflict which must be solved manually.
</para><para>
The merge then was difficult because one contributor had changed many things and corrected
the indentation in many places. Another contributor also had changed much text in the same file,
which resulted in several merge conflicts.
</para><para>
The tool I used then, only showed the changed lines, but not what had changed within these
lines. And there was no information about where only the indentation was changed. The merge
was a little nightmare.
</para><para>
So this was the start. The first version could show differences within a line and showed white space differences.
Later many other features were added to increase the usefulness.
</para><para>
For example if you want to compare some text quickly, then you can copy it to the clipboard and
paste it into either diff window.
</para><para>
A feature that required a big effort was the directory comparison and merge facility, which turned
the program almost into a full file browser.
</para><para>
I hope &kdiff3; works for you too. Have fun!

<para>
   3-way-merging is fully supported. This is useful if two people change code independently.
   The original file (the base) is used to help &kdiff3; to automatically select the correct
   changes.
   The merge-editor below the diff-windows allows you to solve conflicts, while showing you the output you will get.
   You can even edit the output.
   This screenshot shows three input files being merged:

<sect2><title> Comfortable Merge Of Two Or Three Input Files</title>
<para> &kdiff3; can be used to merge two or three input files and automatically
   merges as much as possible. The result is presented in an editable window
   where most conflicts can be solved with a single mouseclick: Select the
   buttons  A/B/C from the button-bar to select the source that should be used.
   You can  also select more than one source. Since this output window is an
   editor even  conflicts which need further corrections can be solved here without
   requiring  another tool.

<sect2><title>Special case: Files with the same name </title>
<para>
If all files have the same name but are in different directories, you can

<para>Example output:</para>
<screen>
Options:
  -m, --merge               Merge the input.
  -b, --base file           Explicit base file. For compatibility with certain tools.
  -o, --output file         Output file. Implies -m. E.g.: -o newfile.txt
  --out file                Output file, again. (For compatibility with certain tools.)
  --auto                    No GUI if all conflicts are auto-solvable. (Needs -o file)
  --qall                    Don't solve conflicts automatically. (For compatibility...)
  --L1 alias1               Visible name replacement for input file 1 (base).
  --L2 alias2               Visible name replacement for input file 2.
  --L3 alias3               Visible name replacement for input file 3.
  -L, --fname alias         Alternative visible name replacement. Supply this once for every input.
  --cs string               Override a config setting. Use once for every setting. E.g.: --cs "AutoAdvance=1"
  --confighelp              Show list of config settings and current values.
  --config file             Use a different config file.
</screen>
<para>The option <option>--cs</option> allows you to adjust a configuration value that is otherwise only adjustable via the configure dialogs. 
But be aware that when &kdiff3; then terminates the changed value will be stored along with the other settings. 
With <option>--confighelp</option> you can find out the names of the available items and current values.</para>
<para>Via <option>--config</option> you can specify a different config file. When you often use &kdiff3; 
with completely different setups this allows you to easily switch between them.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2><title>Ignorable command line options</title>
<para>Many people want to use &kdiff3; with some version control system. 
But when that version control system calls &kdiff3; using command line parameters that &kdiff3; doesn't recognise, then &kdiff3; terminates with an error.
The integration settings allow to specify command line parameters that should be ignored by &kdiff3;. 
They will appear in the usage help like in this example:</para>
<screen>
  --<replaceable>foo</replaceable>                     Ignored. (User defined.)
</screen>
<variablelist>
  <varlistentry><term><emphasis>Command line options to ignore:</emphasis></term><listitem><para>
     A list of options, separated via semicolon ';'. When one of these options appears on the commandline, 
     then &kdiff3; will ignore it and run without reporting an error. 
     (Default is "u;query;html;abort").</para></listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<para>When this isn't enough, then it is recommended to write a shell script that does the option translation.</para>
</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="opendialog"><title>Open-Dialog</title>
<para>
   Since many input files must be selectable, the program has a special open dialog:
</para>
<screenshot><mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="open_dialog.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
</mediaobject></screenshot>
<para>
   The open dialog allows to edit the filenames by hand, selecting a file
   via  the file-browser ("File...") or allows to choose recent files from
   the drop-down lists. If you open the dialog again, then the current names
   still remain there. The third input file is not required. If the
   entry   for "C" remains empty, then only a two file diff analysis will be
   done.
</para><para>
   You can also select a directory via "Dir...". If for A a directory is specified
   then a directory-comparison/merge starts. If A specifies a file but B, C or
   the output specify a directory, then &kdiff3; uses the filename from A in the
   specified directories.
</para><para>
   If "Merge" is selected, then the "Output"-line becomes editable. But it
   is not required to specify the output filename immediately. You can also
   postpone this until saving.
</para><para>
   The "Configure..."-button opens the options-dialog, so that you can set
   the options before running the analysis.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="pasteinput"><title>Paste and Drop Input</title>
<para>
   Sometimes you want to compare parts of a text that is not an own file. &kdiff3; also
   allows you to paste text from the clipboard into the diff input window that has the focus.
   The diff analysis happens immediately then.
   In the open dialog you need not specify files then, but just close it via "Cancel".
</para><para>
   You can also use drag and drop: Drag a file from a file manager
   or selected text from an editor and drop it onto a diff input window.
</para><para>
   What's the idea? Sometimes a file contains two similar functions, but checking how similar
   they really are is a big effort if you first must create two files and then load them. Now
   you can simply copy, paste and compare the relevant sections.
</para><para>
   Note: Currently you cannot drag anything from &kdiff3;. Only dropping in the diff input
   is supported.
</para><para>
   Warning: Some editors still interpret the drag and drop into another program like cut
   (instead of copy) and paste. Your original data might be lost then.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="interpretinginformation"><title>Comparing Files And Interpreting The Information In The Input Windows</title>
<screenshot><mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="screenshot_diff.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
</mediaobject></screenshot>
<sect2><title>Info Line</title><para>
   At the top of each text window is its "info line". The info lines of
   the input windows contain a letter "A", "B" or "C", the editable filename,
   a button for browsing, and the line number of the first visible line in the window. 
   (Note that window "C" is  optional.) Each info line appears in a different color.
</para><para>
   When you selected another file via browsing or finished editing the filename here 
   by pressing enter, the new file will be loaded and 
   compared with the already loaded file(s).
</para></sect2><sect2><title>Coloring</title><para>
   The three input windows are assigned the letters "A", "B" and "C".
   "A"   has  color blue, "B" has green and "C" has magenta. (These are the
   defaults,   but  can be changed in the Settings-Menu.)
</para><para>
   When a difference is detected then the color shows which input file
   differs.   When both other input files differ then the color used to express
   this is   red by default ("Conflict color" in the Settings).
   This colorscheme is especially useful in the case of three input files, which will be
   seen in the next section (<link linkend="merging">Merging</link>).
</para></sect2><sect2><title>Summary Column</title><para>
   Left of each text is the "summary column". If differences occurred on a
   line then the summary column shows the respective color. For a white-space-only
   difference the summary is chequered. For programming languages where white
   space is not so important this is useful to see at one glance if anything
   of importance was modified. (In C/C++ white space is only interesting within
   strings, comments, for the preprocessor, and some only very esoteric situations.)
</para><para>
   The vertical line separating the summary column and the text is interrupted
   if the input file had no lines there. When word-wrap is enabled then this vertical 
   line appears dotted for wrapped lines.
</para></sect2><sect2><title>Overview Column</title><para>
   On the right side a "overview"-column is visible left of the vertical scrollbar.
   It shows the compressed summary column of input "A". All the differences
   and conflicts are visible at one glance. When only two input windows are
   used, then all differences appear red here because every difference is
   also   a conflict. A black rectangle frames the visible part of the inputs.
   For  very long input files, when the number of input lines is bigger than
   the height of the overview column in pixels, then several input lines share
   one overview line. A conflict then has top priority over simple differences,
   which have priority over no change, so that no difference or conflict is
   lost here.  By clicking into this overview column the corresponding text
   will be shown.
</para></sect2><sect2 id="manualdiffhelp"><title>Manually Aligning Lines</title><para>
   Sometimes the algorithm places the wrong lines next to each other. Or you want to compare 
   one piece of text with text at a completely different position in the other file.
   For these situations you can manually instruct &kdiff3; to align certain lines. 
   Mark the text for which you want to improve the alignment with the mouse as you would 
   for copy and paste in the first diff view and then choose "Add Manual Diff Alignment" 
   in the "Diffview"-menu (keyboard shortcut "Ctrl-Y") . An orange bar will appear in 
   the summary column next to the chosen text. Repeat this for the second and 
   (if available) third diff view. &kdiff3; will immediately recalculate the differences everytime you do this.
   and will align the chosen lines. Of course some of the previously matching lines in between 
   might not match anymore.
</para><para>
   Currently merging doesn't support the use of manual diff help.
</para></sect2><sect2 id="joinsplitsections"><title>Manually Joining and Splitting Diff Sections</title><para>
   In some cases &kdiff3; will see too many or too few diff sections for merging. In such a 
   case you can join or split existing sections.
</para><para>
   Add new sections by first selecting text in the lines that belong together in either input window (as for copying to the clipboard). 
   Then choose "Split Diff At Selection" in the "Merge" menu.
   Splits will be added above the first line and below the last line of the selected text.
   If you only want to add one section, then select text beginning at another section-split.
</para><para>
   For joining sections in either input window select something in the lines from the sections to join.
   (You can join several sections in one step too.) Then choose "Join selected Diffs" in the "Merge"-menu.
</para></sect2>
</sect1>


<sect1 id="merging"><title>Merging And The Merge Output Editor Window</title>
<screenshot><mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="screenshot_merge.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
</mediaobject></screenshot>
<para>
   The merge output editor window (below the diff input windows) also has an info line at the top showing "Output:", the
   filename   and "[Modified]" if you edited something. Usually it will contain
   some text  through the automatic merge facilities, but often it will also
   contain conflicts.
</para><para>
   !!! Saving is disabled until all conflicts are resolved !!! (Use the "Go
   to prev/next unsolved conflicts"-buttons to find the remaining conflicts.)
</para><para>
   With only two input files every difference is also a conflict that must
   be solved manually.
</para><para>
   With three input files the first file is treated as base, while the
   second   and third input files contain modifications. When at any line only
   either   input B or input C have changed but not both then the changed source
   will   automatically be selected. Only when B and C have changed on the same
   lines,   then the tool detects a conflict that must be solved manually.
   When B and C are the same, but not the same as A, then C is selected.
</para><sect2><title>The Summary Column</title><para>
   The merge output editor window also has a summary column on the left. It shows the
   letter of the input from which a line was selected or nothing if all three
   sources where equal on a line. For conflicts it shows a questionmark "?"
   and the line shows "&lt;Merge Conflict&gt;", all in red. Because solving
   conflicts  line by line would take very long, the lines are grouped into
   groups that  have the same difference and conflict characteristics.
   But only-white-space-conflicts are separated from non-white-space-conflicts
   in order to ease the merging of files were the indentation changed for many
   lines.
</para></sect2><sect2 id="synchronise_views"><title>Setting The Current Group And Synchronising Merge And Diff View Position</title><para>
   When clicking into  the summary column with the left mouse button in either
   window then the beginning of the group belonging to that line will shown in all windows.
   This group then becomes the "current group". It is highlighted with the
   "Current range (diff) background color" and
   a black bar appears on the left side of the text.
</para></sect2><sect2><title>Choosing Inputs A, B or C For Current Conflict And Editing</title><para>
   The button bar below the menubar contains three input selector buttons 
   containing the letters "A", "B" and "C". Click the input selector 
   button to insert (or remove if already inserted) the lines from the respective source.
   To choose the lines from several inputs click the respective buttons in the
   needed order. For example if you want that the lines from "B" appear before 
   the lines from "A" in the output, first click "B", then "A".
</para><para>
   If you use the auto-advance option 
   (<link linkend="autoadvance">"Automatically go to next unsolved conflict after source selection"</link>),
   you should disable this before choosing lines from several inputs or if you want to
   edit the lines after your choice. Otherwise &kdiff3; will jump to the next
   conflict after choosing the first input.
</para><para>
   It is often helpful directly edit the merge output. 
   The summary column will show "m" for every line that was manually modified. 
   When for instance the differences are aligned in a way that simply choosing 
   the inputs won't be satisfactory, then you can mark the needed text and use 
   normal <link linkend="selections">copy and paste</link> to put it into the merge output.
</para><para>
   Sometimes, when a line is removed either by automatic merge or by editing
   and no other lines remain in that group, then the text &lt;No src line&gt;
   will appear in that line. This is just a placeholder for the group for
   when  you might change your mind and select some source again. This text won't
   appear in the saved file or in any selections you want to copy and paste.
</para><para>
   The text "&lt;Merge Conflict&gt;" will appear in the clipboard if you
   copy and   paste some text containing such a line. But still be careful to
   do so.
</para></sect2><sect2><title>Choosing Input A, B, or C for All Conflicts</title><para>
   The normal merge will start by solving simple conflicts automatically.
   But the "Merge"-menu provides some actions for other common needs.
   If you have to select the same source for most conflicts, then you can
   choose "A", "B" or "C" everywhere, or only for the remaining unsolved
   conflicts, or for unsolved white space conflicts. If you want to decide every
   single delta yourself, you can "Set deltas to conflicts". Or if you want to
   return to the automatic choices of &kdiff3; then select
   "Automatically solve simple conflicts". &kdiff3; then restarts the merge.
   For actions that change your previous modifications &kdiff3; will ask for your
   confirmation before proceeding.
</para><para>
   Note: When choosing either source for unsolved white space conflicts and
   the options "Ignore Numbers" or "Ignore C/C++ Comments" are used then changes in
   numbers or comments will be treated like white space too.

</para></sect2><sect2 id="vcskeywordsmergesupport"><title>Automatic Merge of Version Control Keywords and History (Log)</title><para>
Many version control systems support special keywords in the file. (e.g. "&#36;Date&#36;", 
"&#36;Header&#36;", "&#36;Author&#36;", "&#36;Log&#36;" etc.) During the 
check-in the version control system (VCS) changes these lines. For instance 
"&#36;Date&#36;" will turn into "&#36;Date: 2005/03/22 18:45:01 &#36;". Since this line will 
be different in every version of the file, it would require manual interaction 
during the merge.
</para><para>
&kdiff3; offers automatic merge for these items. For simple lines that match the 
"Auto merge regular expression"-option in all input-files &kdiff3; will choose 
the line from B or - if available - from C. (Additionally it is necessary that the lines 
in question line up in the comparison and the previous line contains no conflict.)
This auto merge can either be run immediately after a merge starts (activate the option 
"Run regular expression auto merge on merge start") or later via the merge 
menu "Run Regular Expression Auto Merge".
</para><para>
Automatic merge for version control history (also called "log") is also supported.
The history automerge can either run immediately when the merge starts by activating the 
option "Merge version control history on merge start" or later via the merge menu 
"Automatically Solve History Conflicts".
</para><para>
Usually the version control history begins with a line containing the keyword "&#36;Log&#36;".
This must be matched by the "History start regular expression"-option.
&kdiff3; detects which subsequent lines are in the history by analysing the leading characters 
that came before the "&#36;Log&#36;"-keyword. If the same "leading comment"-characters also appears in the following
lines, then they are also included in the history.
</para><para>
During each check-in the VCS writes a unique line specifying version-, date- and time-information 
followed by lines with user comments.
These lines form one history-entry. This history section grows with every check-in and the 
most recent entries appear at the top (after the history start line). 
</para><para>
When for parallel development two or more developers check-in a branch of the file then 
the merge history will contain several entries that appear as conflicts during the merge 
of the branches. Since merging these can become very tedious, &kdiff3; offers support with two 
possible strategies: Just insert the history information from both contributors at the top
or sort the history information by a user defined key.
</para><para>
The just-insert-all-entries-method is easier to configure. &kdiff3; just needs a method to
detect, which lines belong to one history entry. Most VCS insert an empty line after each
history entry. If there are no other empty lines, this is a sufficient criterion for &kdiff3;.
Just set an empty "History entry start regular expression". If the empty line criterion 
isn't sufficient, you can specify a regular expression to detect the history entry start.
</para><para>
Note that &kdiff3; will remove duplicate history entrys. If a history entry appeared several times
in the history of a input file, only one entry will remain in the output.
</para><para>
If you want to sort the history, then you have to specify how the sort key should be built.
Use parentheses in the "History entry start regular expression" to group parts of the regular 
expression that should later be used for the sort key.
Then specify the "History entry start sort key order" specifying a comma "," separated list of 
numbers referring to the position of the group in the regular expression.
</para><para>
Because this is not so easy to get right immediately, you are able to test and improve
the regular expressions and key-generation in a dedicated dialog by pressing the 
"Test your regular expressions"-button.
</para><para>Example: Assume a history that looks like this:
<screen>
/**************************************************************************
** HISTORY:    &#36;Log: \toms_merge_main_view\MyApplication\src\complexalgorithm.cpp &#36;
**
**     \main\integration_branch_12   2 Apr 2001 10:45:41   tom
**  Merged branch simon_branch_15.
**
**     \main\henry_bugfix_branch_7\1   30 Mar 2001 19:22:05   henry
**  Improved the speed for subroutine convertToMesh().
**  Fixed crash.
**************************************************************************/
</screen>
The history start line matches the regular expression ".*\&#36;Log.*\&#36;.*". Then follow 
the history entries.
</para><para>
The line with the "&#36;Log&#36;"-keyword begins with two "*" after which follows a space. 
&kdiff3; uses the first non-white-space string as "leading comment" and assumes that
the history ends in the first line without this leading comment. In this example the
last line ends with a string that also starts with two "*", but instead of a space 
character more "*" follow. Hence this line ends the history.
</para><para>
If history sorting isn't required then the history entry start line regular expression
could look like this. (This line is split in two because it wouldn't fit otherwise.)
<screen>
\s*\\main\\\S+\s+[0-9]+ (Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec)
 [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9] [0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]\s+.*
</screen>
For details about regular expressions please see the
<ulink url="http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/qregexp.html#details">regular expression documentation by Trolltech</ulink>.
Note that "\s" (with lowercase "s") matches any white space and "\S" (with uppercase "S") matches any non-white-space.
In our example the history entry start contains first the version info with reg. exp. "\\main\\\S+", the date consisting of day "[0-9]+", month "(Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec)" and year "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]", the time "[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]" and finally the developers login name ".*".
</para><para>
Note that the "leading comment"-characters (in the example "**") will already be removed by &kdiff3; 
before trying to match, hence the regular expression begins with a match for none or more white-space characters "\s*".
Because comment characters can differ in each file (e.g. C/C++ uses other comment characters than a Perl script)
&kdiff3; takes care of the leading comment characters and you should not specify them in the regular expression.
</para><para>
If you require a sorted history. Then the sortkey must be calculated. For this the 
relevant parts in the regular expression must be grouped by parentheses. 
(The extra parentheses can also stay in if history sorting is disabled.)
<screen>
\s*\\main\\(\S+)\s+([0-9]+) (Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec)
 ([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]) ([0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9])\s+(.*)
</screen>
The parentheses now contain 1. version info, 2. day, 3. month, 4. year, 5. time, 6. name. 
But if we want to sort by date and time, we need to construct a key with the elements in a different order of appearance:
First the year, followed by month, day, time, version info and name. Hence the sortkey order to specify is "4,3,2,5,1,6".
</para><para>
Because  month names aren't good for sorting ("Apr" would be first) &kdiff3; detects in which order 
the month names were given and uses that number instead ("Apr"->"04"). 
And if a pure number is found it will be transformed to a 4-digit value with leading zeros for sorting.
Finally the resulting sort key for the first history entry start line will be:

<sect1 id="navigation"><title>Navigation And Editing</title>
<para>
   Much navigation will be done with the scroll bars and the mouse but
   you  can also navigate with the keys. If you click into either window then
   you  can use the cursor buttons left, right, up, down, page up, page down,
   home,  end, ctrl-home, ctrl-end as you would in other programs. The overview-column
   next to the vertical scroll bar of the input files can also be used  for
   navigating by clicking into it.
</para><para>
   You can also use the wheel mouse to scroll up and down.
</para><para>
   In the merge output editor you can also use the other keys for editing.
   You can toggle between insert and overwrite mode with the insert key. (Default
   is insert-mode.)
</para><para>
   A left-mouse-button-click into any summary column will synchronise all
   windows to show the beginning of the same group of lines (as explained
   in section <link linkend="synchronise_views">"Setting The Current Group And Synchronising Merge And Diff View Position"</link>).
</para><para>
   The button bar also contains nine navigation buttons with which you can
   jump to the current/first/last difference, to the next/previous difference
   (ctrl-down/ctrl-up), to the next/previous conflict (ctrl-pgdown/ctrl-pgup),
   or to the next/previous unsolved conflict. Note that for &kdiff3; a "conflict"
   that was not automatically solved at the start of the merge stays a "conflict"
   even if it is solved. Hence the necessity to distinguish "unsolved conflicts".
</para>
<sect2 id="autoadvance"><title>Auto-Advance</title>
<para>
   There also is a button "Automatically go to next unsolved conflict after
   source selection" (Auto-Advance). If you enable this, then, when one source
   is selected, &kdiff3; will jump to and select the next unsolved conflict
   automatically. This can help when you always want to choose one source only.
   When you need both sources, or you want to edit after selecting, then you
   probably want to switch this off. Before proceeding to the next unsolved conflict
   &kdiff3; shows you the effect of your choice for a short time. This delay is
   adjustable in the Diff- &amp; Merge-Settings: You can
   specify the "Auto-Advance delay" in milli seconds between 0 and 2000. Hint:
   Tired of many clicks? - Use a small Auto-Advance-delay and the shortcuts
   Ctrl-1/2/3 to select A/B/C for many conflicts.
</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="selections"><title>Select, Copy And Paste</title>
<para>
   The input windows don't show a cursor, so selections must be made
   with   the mouse by clicking with the left mouse button at the start, holding
   down   the mousebutton and moving to the end, where you release the mouse
   button   again. You can also select a word by double clicking it. In the merge
   output   editor you can also select via the keyboard by holding the "shift"-button
   and navigation with the cursor keys.
</para><para>
   If the selection exceeds the visible range you can move the mouse over the 
   window borders which causes &kdiff3; to scroll in that direction. 
</para><para>
   For very large selections you can also use the navigation keys while holding down 
   the mouse. E.g. use page up and page down to quickly go to a certain position. At the 
   end position release the mouse button.
</para><para>
   In order to select everything in the current window use menu "Edit"->"Select All" (Ctrl-A).
</para><para>
   To copy to the clipboard you must press the "Copy"-button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert).
   But there exists an option "Auto Copy Selection". If this is enabled,
   then whatever you select is copied immediately and you don't need to explicitely
   copy. But pay attention when using this because the contents of the clipboard
   might then be destroyed accidentally.
</para><para>
   "Cut" (Ctrl-X or Shift-Delete) copies to the clipboard and deletes the
   selected text.
</para><para>
   "Paste" (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text in the clipboard at the 
   cursorposition or over the current selection.
   If you paste to either diff input window the contents of the clipboard will 
   be shown in that window and the comparison will restart immediately. This is 
   useful if you want to quickly grab a piece of text from somewhere and 
   compare it with something else without first creating files.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="saving"><title>Saving</title>
<para>
   Saving will only be allowed, when all conflicts were solved. If the file
   already exists and the "Backup files"-option is enabled then the existing
   file will be renamed with an ".orig"-extension, but if such a file exists
   it will be deleted. When you exit or start another diff-analysis and data
   wasn't saved yet, then &kdiff3; will ask if you want to save, cancel or proceed
   without saving. (&kdiff3; does not catch any signals. So if you "kill" &kdiff3;
   then your data will be lost.)
</para><para>
   Line endings are saved according to the normal method on the underlying
   operating system. For Unices each line ends with an linefeed-character "\n",
   while for Win32-based systems each line ends with a carriage-return + a linefeed
   "\r\n". &kdiff3; does not preserve the line-endings of the input files, which
   also means that you shouldn't use &kdiff3; with binary files.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="find"><title>Finding Strings</title>
<para>
   You can search for a string in any text-window of &kdiff3;. The "Find ..."-command
   (Ctrl-F) in the Edit-menu opens a dialog that lets you specify the string
   to search for. You can also select the windows which should be searched.
   Searching will always start at the top. Use the "Find Next"-command (F3)
   to proceed to the next occurrence. If you select to search several windows then the first
   window will be searched from top to bottom before the search starts in the next
   window at the top again, etc.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="printing"><title>Printing</title>
<para>
   &kdiff3; supports printing for textfile differences. The "Print..."-command (Ctrl-P) 
   in the File-menu opens a dialog that allows you to select the printer and to adjust
   other options.

   </para></listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</para>
<para>
The idea is to allow the user greater flexibility while configuring the diff-result.
But this requires an external program, and many users don't want to write one themselves.
The good news is that very often <command>sed</command> or <command>perl</command> 
will do the job. 
</para>
<para>Example: Simple testcase: Consider file a.txt (6 lines):
<screen>
      aa
      ba
      ca
      da
      ea
      fa
</screen>
And file b.txt (3 lines):
<screen>
      cg
      dg
      eg
</screen>
Without a preprocessor the following lines would be placed next to each other:
<screen>
      aa - cg
      ba - dg
      ca - eg
      da
      ea
      fa
</screen>
This is probably not wanted since the first letter contains the actually interesting information.
To help the matching algorithm to ignore the second letter we can use a line matching preprocessor 
command, that replaces 'g' with 'a':
<screen>
   <command>sed</command> 's/g/a/'
</screen>
With this command the result of the comparison would be:
<screen>
      aa
      ba
      ca - cg
      da - dg
      ea - eg
      fa
</screen>
Internally the matching algorithm sees the files after running the line matching preprocessor,
but on the screen the file is unchanged. (The normal preprocessor would change the data also on 
the screen.)
</para>

<sect2 id="sedbasics"><title><command>sed</command> Basics</title>
<para>
This section only introduces some very basic features of <command>sed</command>. For more
information see <ulink url="info:/sed">info:/sed</ulink> or 
<ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/html_mono/sed.html">
http://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/html_mono/sed.html</ulink>.
A precompiled version for Windows can be found at <ulink url="http://unxutils.sourceforge.net">
http://unxutils.sourceforge.net</ulink>.
Note that the following examples assume that the <command>sed</command>-command is in some 
directory in the PATH-environment variable. If this is not the case, you have to specify the full absolute
path for the command. 
</para>
<note><para>Also note that the following examples use the single quotation mark (') which won't work for Windows. 
On Windows you should use the double quotation marks (") instead.</para></note>
<para>
In this context only the <command>sed</command>-substitute-command is used:
<screen>
   <command>sed</command> 's/<replaceable>REGEXP</replaceable>/<replaceable>REPLACEMENT</replaceable>/<replaceable>FLAGS</replaceable>'
</screen>
Before you use a new command within &kdiff3;, you should first test it in a console.
Here the <command>echo</command>-command is useful. Example:
<screen>
   <command>echo</command> abrakadabra | <command>sed</command> 's/a/o/'
   -> obrakadabra
</screen>
This example shows a very simple sed-command that replaces the first occurance 
of "a" with "o". If you want to replace all occurances then you need the "g"-flag:
<screen>
   <command>echo</command> abrakadabra | <command>sed</command> 's/a/o/g'
   -> obrokodobro
</screen>
The "|"-symbol is the pipe-command that transfers the output of the previous 
command to the input of the following command. If you want to test with a longer file
then you can use <command>cat</command> on Unix-like systems or <command>type</command> 
on Windows-like systems. <command>sed</command> will do the substitution for each line.
<screen>
   <command>cat</command> <replaceable>filename</replaceable> | <command>sed</command> <replaceable>options</replaceable>
</screen>
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sedforkdiff3"><title>Examples For <command>sed</command>-Use In &kdiff3;</title>
<sect3><title>Ignoring Other Types Of Comments</title>
<para>
Currently &kdiff3; understands only C/C++ comments. Using the
Line-Matching-Preprocessor-Command you can also ignore
other types of comments, by converting them into C/C++-comments.

Example: To ignore comments starting with "#", you would like to convert them
to "//". Note that you also must enable the "Ignore C/C++-Comments" option to get 
an effect. An appropriate Line-Matching-Preprocessor-Command would be:

<screen>
   <command>sed</command> 's/#/\/\//'
</screen>
Since for <command>sed</command> the "/"-character has a special meaning, it is necessary to place the 
"\"-character before each "/" in the replacement-string. Sometimes the "\" is required
to add or remove a special meaning of certain characters. The single quotation marks (') before 
and after the substitution-command are important now, because otherwise the shell will
try to interpret some special characters like '#', '$' or '\' before passing them to 
<command>sed</command>. <emphasis>Note that on Windows you will need the double quotation marks (") here. Windows
substitutes other characters like '%', so you might have to experiment a little bit.</emphasis>
</para>
</sect3>
<sect3><title>Caseinsensitive Diff</title>
<para>
Use the following Line-Matching-Preprocessor-Command to convert all input to uppercase:
<screen>
   <command>sed</command> 's/\(.*\)/\U\1/'
</screen>
Here the ".*" is a regular expression that matches any string and in this context matches 
all characters in the line. 
The "\1" in the replacement string refers to the matched text within the first pair of "\(" and "\)".
The "\U" converts the inserted text to uppercase.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Ignoring Version Control Keywords</title>
<para>
CVS and other version control systems use several keywords to insert automatically
generated strings (<ulink url="info:/cvs/Keyword substitution">info:/cvs/Keyword substitution</ulink>).
All of them follow the pattern "$KEYWORD generated text$". We now need a
Line-Matching-Preprocessor-Command that removes only the generated text:
<screen>
   <command>sed</command> 's/\$\(Revision\|Author\|Log\|Header\|Date\).*\$/\$\1\$/'
</screen>
The "\|" separates the possible keywords. You might want to modify this list 
according to your needs.
The "\" before the "$" is necessary because otherwise the "$" matches the end of the line.
</para>
<para>
While experimenting with <command>sed</command> you might come to understand and even like
these regular expressions. They are useful because there are many other programs that also 
support similar things.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Ignoring Numbers</title>
<para>
Ignoring numbers actually is a built-in option. But as another example, this is how
it would look as a Line-Matching-Preprocessor-command.
<screen>
   <command>sed</command> 's/[0123456789.-]//g'
</screen>
Any character within '[' and ']' is a match and will be replaced with nothing.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Ignoring Certain Columns</title>
<para>
Sometimes a text is very strictly formatted, and contains columns that you always want to ignore, while there are
other columns you want to preserve for analysis. In the following example the first five columns (characters) are 
ignored, the next ten columns are preserved, then again five columns are ignored and the rest of the line is preserved.
<screen>
   <command>sed</command> 's/.....\(..........\).....\(.*\)/\1\2/'
</screen>
Each dot '.' matches any single character. The "\1" and "\2" in the replacement string refer to the matched text within the first 
and second pair of "\(" and "\)" denoting the text to be preserved.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Combining Several Substitutions</title>
<para>
Sometimes you want to apply several substitutions at once. You can then use the 
semicolon ';' to separate these from each other. Example:
<screen>
   <command>echo</command> abrakadabra | <command>sed</command> 's/a/o/g;s/\(.*\)/\U\1/'
   -> OBROKODOBRO
</screen>
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Using <command>perl</command> instead of <command>sed</command></title>
<para>
Instead of <command>sed</command> you might want to use something else like 
<command>perl</command>.
<screen>
   <command>perl</command> -p -e 's/<replaceable>REGEXP</replaceable>/<replaceable>REPLACEMENT</replaceable>/<replaceable>FLAGS</replaceable>'
</screen>
But some details are different in <command>perl</command>. Note that where 
<command>sed</command> needed "\(" and "\)" <command>perl</command>
requires the simpler "(" and ")" without preceding '\'. Example:
<screen>
   <command>sed</command> 's/\(.*\)/\U\1/'
   <command>perl</command> -p -e 's/(.*)/\U\1/'
</screen>
</para>

<sect2><title>Warning</title>
<para>
The preprocessor-commands are often very useful, but as with any option that modifies
your texts or hides away certain differences automatically, you might accidentally overlook 
certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.
</para><para>
For this reason during a merge if a normal preprocessor-command is being used &kdiff3; 
will tell you so and ask you if it should be disabled or not. 
But it won't warn you if a Line-Matching-Preprocessor-command is active. The merge will not complete until
all conflicts are solved. If you disabled "Show White Space" then the differences that
were removed with the Line-Matching-Preprocessor-command will also be invisible. If the 
Save-button remains disabled during a merge (because of remaining conflicts), make sure to enable 
"Show White Space". If you don't wan't to merge these less important differences manually
you can select "Choose [A|B|C] For All Unsolved White space Conflicts" in the Merge-menu.

<sect1 id="dirmergeintro"><title>Introduction into Directory Comparison and Merge</title>
<para>
   Often programmers must modify many files in a directory to achieve their
   purpose. For this &kdiff3; also lets you compare and merge complete directories
   recursively!
</para><para>
   Even though comparing and merging directories seems to be quite obvious,
   there are several details that you should know about. Most important is of
   course the fact that now many files might be affected by each operation.
   If you don't have backups of your original data, then it can be very hard
   or even impossible to return to the original state. So before starting a merge,
   make sure that your data is safe, and going back is possible. If you make
   an archive or use some version control system is your decision, but even
   experienced programmers and integrators need the old sources now and then.
   And note that even though I (the author of &kdiff3;) try to do my best, I can't
   guarantee that there are no bugs. According to the GNU-GPL there is NO WARRANTY
   whatsoever for this program. So be humble and always keep in mind:

<sect1 id="dothemerge"><title>Doing A Directory Merge</title>
<para>
   You can either merge the currently selected item (file or directory), or all items.
   When you have made all your operation choices (in all subdirectories too)
   then you can start the merge.
</para><para>
   Be aware that if you didn't specify a destination directory explicitely,
   then the destination will be "C" in three directory mode, "B" in two directory
   merge mode, and in sync-mode it will be "A" or/and "B".
</para><para>
   If you have specified a destination directory also check that all items
   that should be in the output, are in the tree. There are some options that
   cause certain items to be omitted from the directory comparison and merge.
   Check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:
</para>

</itemizedlist>
<para>
   If you change the settings in order to list more files, you must do a rescan via menu "Directory"->"Rescan" yourself.
   (The reason for this is that for faster comparison-speed &kdiff3; omits the comparison for files suppressed by these criteria.)
   If you changed your file and dir patterns to exclude files, then the file-list will immediately be updated on closing
   the options-dialog.
</para><para>
   Note that when you write to a completely new directory then you usually also want to copy the identical files.
   In that case enable the "Show Identical Files"-option. If your destination-directory is one of the inputs, 
   then this isn't necessary because the file is already there.
</para><para>
   If you are satisfied so far, the rest is easy.
</para><para>
   To merge all items: Select "Start/Continue directory merge" in the "Directory"-menu
   or press F7 (which is the default shortcut).
   To merge only the current item: Select "Run Operation For Current Item"
   or press F6.
</para><para>
   If due to conflicting filetypes still some items with invalid operations
   exist, then a messagebox will appear and these items will be pointed out,
   so you can select a valid operation for the item.
</para><para>
   If you merge all items a dialog will appear giving you the options "Do it", "Simulate
   it" and "Cancel".
</para>
<itemizedlist>

   Then &kdiff3; will run the specified operation for all items. If manual
   interaction  is required (single file merge), then a merge window will open
   (<link linkend="dirmergebigscreenshot">see the big screenshot</link>).
</para><para>
   When you have finished with manually merging a file, again select "Start/Continue directory
   merge" or the key F7. If you haven't saved it yet, a dialog will ask you to
   do so. Then &kdiff3; will continue with the next item.
</para><para>
   When &kdiff3; encounters an error, it will tell you so and will show the
   verbose-status-information. At the bottom of this list, there will be some
   error messages which should help you to understand the cause of the problem.
   When you continue merging (F7 key) &kdiff3; will give you the choice to retry
   or skip the item that caused the problem. This means that before continuing
   you can choose another operation or solve the problem by other means.
</para><para>
   When the merge is complete, then &kdiff3; will inform you via a message
   box.
</para><para>
   If some items were merged individually before running the directorymerge then 
   &kdiff3; remembers this (while this
   merge-session goes on), and doesn't merge them again when later the merge for
   all items is run. Even when the merge was skipped or nothing was saved these
   items count as completed. Only when you change the merge operation the 
   "Done"-status of the item will be removed and it can be merged again.

<para>
   Usually the directory merge list view remains visible while a single file
   is compared or merged. With the mouse you can move the the splitter bar that
   separates the file list from the text-diff windows. If you don't want this,
   you can disable "Split Screen View" in the "Directory"-menu. Then you can
   use "Toggle View" in the "Directory"-menu to switch between the file list
   and the text-diff view that then occupy the full screen.

<sect2><title>Comparing or Merging a Single File</title>
<para>
   Probably you will prefer a simple double mouse click on a file in order
   to compare it. Nevertheless there also exists an entry in the "Directory"-menu.
   You can also directly merge a single file by selecting it and 
   choosing "Merge current file" in the "Merge"-Menu. On saving the
   result, the status will be set to done, and the file will not be merged again
   if a directory merge is started.

   Sometimes you need to compare or merge files with different names (e.g. the current 
   file and the backup in the same folder).
</para><para>
   Select the exact file by clicking onto the icon in the column A, B or C. The first 
   file selected thus will be marked with an "A", the second and third with "B" and "C" 
   regardless on what column they are in. Only up to three files can be chosen like this.
</para><para>
   Proceed by choosing "Compare Explicitely Selected Files" or "Merge Explicitely 
   Selected Files" from the "Directory"-menu. For your convenience these menu entries 
   also appear as context menu when you right-click the last selected file.

KDE supports networktransparency via KIO-slaves. &kdiff3; uses this
for reading input files and for scanning directories.
This means that you can specify files and directories on local and
remote resources via URLs.

<listitem><para>
   A path can be relative and can contain "." or "..". This is not possible for URLs
   which are always absolute.
</para></listitem><listitem><para>
   Special characters must be written with "escaping". ("#"->"%23", space->"%20", etc.)

  <!-- Is this still valid? -->
It's main use is as difference-viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop always starts the
internal difference viewer first. To invoke &kdiff3; press the right mouse button
on the difference viewer window and select "Show in KDiff3Part" from the contextmenu.
</para><para>
&kdiff3; normally requires two complete files as input. When used as part &kdiff3;
will assume that the inputfile is a patch-file in the unified format. &kdiff3;
then retrieves the original filenames from the patch-file. At least one of
the two files must be available. &kdiff3; will then invoke <command>patch</command> to
recreate the second file.
</para><para>
In Konqueror you can select a patch-file and select "Preview in"-"KDiff3Part" from
the contextmenu. Be aware that this won't work if none of the original files are
available, and it is not reliable if the original file(s) have changed since the
patch-file was generated.

   Why is it called "&kdiff3;"?
</para></question><answer><para>
   Tools named "KDiff" and "KDiff2" (now called "Kompare") already exist. Also "KDiff3" should suggest
   that it can merge like the "diff3"-tool in the Diff-Tool collection.

<qandaentry><question><para>
   Why did I release it under GPL?
</para></question><answer><para>
   I'm using GPL programs for a very long time now and learned very much
   by  having a look at many of the sources. Hence this is my "Thank You"
   to   all  programmers that also did so or will do the same.
</para></answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>
   Some buttons and functions are missing. What's wrong?
</para></question><answer><para>
   You compiled from source but you probably didn't specify the correct KDE-prefix
   with configure. By default configure wants to install in /usr/local but then KDE can't
   find the user-interface ressource file (i.e. kdiff3ui.rc). The README-file contains
   more information about the correct prefix.
</para></answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>
   Often lines that are similar but not identical appear next to each other
   but sometimes not. Why?
</para></question><answer><para>
   Lines where only the amount of white space characters is different
   are   treated as "equal" at first, while just one different non-white character
   causes the lines to be "different". If similar lines appear next to each
   other, this actually is coincidence but this fortunately is often the case.
   See also <link linkend="manualdiffhelp">Manual Diff Help</link>.
</para></answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>
   Why must all conflicts be solved before the merge result can be saved?
</para></question><answer><para>
   For each equal or different section the editor in the merge result
   window    remembers where it begins or ends. This is needed so that conflicts
   can  be solved manually by simply selecting the source button (A, B or C).
   This  information is lost while saving as text and it is too much effort to
   create  a special file format that supports saving and restoring all necessary
   information.
</para></answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>
   How can I synchronise the diff and merge views, so that all views show the same text position?
</para></question><answer><para>
  Click into the summary column left of the text. (<link linkend="synchronise_views">See also here.</link>)
</para></answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>
   Why does the editor in the merge result window not have an "undo"-function?
</para></question><answer><para>
  This was too much effort until now. You can always
  restore a version from one source (A, B or C) by clicking the respective
  button. For big editing the use of another editor is recommended anyway.
</para></answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>
   When I removed some text, then suddenly "&lt;No src line&gt;" appeared
   and cannot be deleted. What does that mean and how can one remove this?
</para></question><answer><para>
   For each equal or different section the editor in the merge result
   window    remembers where it begins or ends. "&lt;No src line&gt;" means
   that    there is nothing left in a section, not even a new line character.
   This  can happen either while merging automatically or by editing. This is
   no problem,   since this hint won't appear in the saved file. If you want
   the orignal source  back just select the section (click on the left summary
   column) and then click the source button with the needed contents (A/B or
   C).

   Why doesn't &kdiff3; support syntax-highlighting?
</para></question><answer><para>
   &kdiff3; already uses many colors for difference highlighting. More
   highlighting    would be confusing. Use another editor for this.

<qandaentry><question><para>
   Can I use &kdiff3; to compare OpenOffice.Org, Word, Excel, PDF-, &etc; files?
</para></question><answer><para>
   Although &kdiff3; will analyse any kind of file the result will probably
   not be very satisfactory for you.
</para><para>
   &kdiff3; was made to compare pure text files. OpenOffice, Word, Excel etc.
   store much more information in the files (about fonts, pictures, pages,
   colors etc.) which &kdiff3; doesn't know about. So &kdiff3; will 
   show you the contents of the file interpreted as pure text, but 
   this might be unreadable or at least it will look very odd.
</para><para>
   Since most programs nowadays store their contents in XML-format, you might 
   be able to read it as pure text. So if the change was only small,
   &kdiff3; still might help you.
</para><para>
   The best solution if you only want to compare the text (without embedded 
   objects like pictures) is to use "Select All" and "Copy" in your program 
   to copy the interesting text to the clipoard and then in &kdiff3; paste the 
   text into either diff input window.

   Where has the the directory option "List only deltas" gone?
</para></question><answer><para>
   There are now several <link linkend="selectingvisiblefiles">"Show"-options</link> in the directory menu.
   Disabling "Show identical files" will achieve what enabling "List only deltas" used to do.

<qandaentry><question><para>
   How can I make a big selection in the diff input window
   because scrolling takes so long?
</para></question><answer><para>
   Start the selection as usual (click and hold the left mouse button). 
   Then use the navigation keys (e.g. page up, page down) while holding the left mouse button down.
