KDiff3-Version: 0.9.97

KDiff3 runs best on KDE but can be built without it, depending only on Qt-libs.
These are available for Un*x, Windows, Mac.
Thus there are many setup possibilities to consider.

From version 0.9.94 on the main target platform is KDE4/Qt4.
For KDiff3 for KDE3/Qt3 use KDiff3-0.9.92 or older.

Introduction
------------

KDiff3 is a program that
- compares and merges two or three input files or directories,
- shows the differences line by line and character by character (!),
- provides an automatic merge-facility and
- an integrated editor for comfortable solving of merge-conflicts
- has support for KDE-KIO (ftp, sftp, http, fish, smb),
- has an intuitive graphical user interface,
- provides a context menu for KDE-Konqueror and Windows-Explorer,
- supports 64 bit systems. (Some build issues are discussed in here.)

Requirements & Installation
---------------------------

- for KDE4:
   From version 0.9.94 on KDiff3 supports KDE4.
   For installation on most distributions you usually also need these packages
   (names as on opensuse):
   - g++ (g++, version 3.4 or newer)
   - libqt4-devel (Qt4-libs, version 4.4.0 or newer)
   - libkde4-devel (KDE4 Header files and development libraries)
   - libkonq-devel (optional, needed for the kdiff3-plugin, if not installed
                    then the contextmenu plugin for konqueror won't be built.)
   - cmake (>2.6, checks dependencies and creates the appropriate Makefiles for
     your system)

   Typically in a terminal (e.g. konsole) you cd into the kdiff3-directory and
   run "./configure kde4". This script is essentially the same as these commands:

      mkdir releaseKde
      cd releaseKde
      # Find out your KDE4-directory and note the result
      kde4-config --prefix
      # create Makefile, replace <KDE4-prefix> with the prior result
      cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<KDE4-prefix>
      # run make (compile and link)
      make
      # install as root user
      sudo make install

   Now KDiff3 should be ready to use. Type "kdiff3" to start it.
   There should also be a entry in your KDE-start menu in
   "(Applications->)Development".

   For creating a debug version:
      mkdir debug
      cd debug
      # Find out your KDE4-directory and note the result
      kde4-config --prefix
      cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<KDE4-prefix> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull
      make
      sudo make install

   The <KDE4-prefix> depends on your distribution:
   The command "kde4-config --prefix" should tell you.
   - For opensuse 11 use "/usr".

- Building KDiff3 with Qt4-libs, but without KDE
    - for Linux/Un*x
    - for Windows
    - for Mac

   The version 0.9.97 requires Qt 4.4.0 or newer (from http://qt-project.org/) for
   compilation.

   You always need:
      - kdiff3-0.9.97.tar.gz

      - for Un*x:    gcc, g++ with version >=3.4.2
                     Qt-X11-libraries

      - for Windows: Qt-win-libs
                     If you have the Qt4 commercial edition, then compile with
                     Visual Studio.NET 2003 or newer.
                     If you use the Qt4 open source edition, then you'll need
                     MinGW.
                     I verified that compilation and debugging works with
                     these packages (probably newer ones will also work):
                     - Use MinGW-5.1.4.exe or newer to install the following
                       or newer:
                       - gcc-core-3.4.5-20060117-1.tar.gz
                       - binutils-2.17.50-20060824-1.tar.gz
                       - gcc-g++-3.4.5-20060117-1.tar.gz
                       - mingw-runtime-3.14.tar.gz
                       - mingw32-make-3.81-2.tar.gz
                       - w32api-3.11.tar.gz
                     - gdb-6.3-2.exe (for debugging)

      - for Mac:     gcc, g++ with version >=3.4.2
                     Qt-Mac-libraries
      - Optional: Qt Creator IDE: Development environment optimized for Qt
        (from http://qt-project.org)

  Build-instructions (Un*x):
    Assuming Qt is correctly installed run "./configure qt4" which essentially
    does the same as:
    - mkdir releaseQt
    - cd releaseQt
    - qmake ../src-QT4/kdiff3.pro
    - make (or "gmake" for GNU-Make)

  Build-instructions (Windows):
    - If you use Qt Creator from the SDK just load the src-QT4\kdiff3.pro 
      file and build.
    On the command line (cmd.exe):
    - set QTDIR=<QT4-dir>         e.g.: c:\qt\4.4.1
      set "PATH=%QTDIR%\bin;%PATH%"
    - Prepare compiler settings:
      For Visual Studio run the respective vsvars32.bat
      For MinGW add the path: E.g. set "PATH=c:\mingw\bin;%PATH%"
    - cd into the directory kdiff3-0.9.97\src-Qt4 and type
    - qmake kdiff3.pro
    - Either "nmake" for Visual Studio or "mingw32-make" depending on what you
      have.  

  Debugging with MinGW under Windows:
    - Qt Creator worked very well as debugger frontend too!
    - Debugging without gdb on the console:
      - The qt-win-opensource-4.4.1-mingw.exe only installs release dlls. You
        will have to compile the debug dlls yourself. Enter the
        qt-4.4.1-directory and run "configure -debug" and then "mingw32-make".
      - cd into the directory kdiff3-0.9.97\src-Qt4
      - edit the file "Makefile.Debug" and in the LFLAGS replace
        "-Wl,-subsystem,windows" with "-Wl,-subsystem,console" (this is
        necessary so that gdb can send a break signal to the running program)
      - mingw32-make debug (create a debuggable executable)
      - gdb debug\kdiff3.exe
      - At the "(gdb)"-prompt type "run" and enter to start.
      - While the program runs you can't set breakpoints, first interrupt it
        with Ctrl-C.
      - Use "help" to find out about how to use gdb. (Important commands: run,
        break, backtrace, print, quit)
         Using break with c++-methods requires to specify the parameter types
         too. Breakpoints in constructors might not work.

  Building KDiff3 (Qt4) for Mac OSX: 
    0) Build with Qt Creator from the SDK and src-QT4\kdiff3.pro.
    Building a universal binary (by Michael Schmidt, perhaps outdated):
    1) Install Qt/Mac 4.x with thread support, static libraries and universal
    flag. (For Qt4 run "configure -static"; only necessary if the final binary
    should not require shared Qt4-libs.)
    2) cd .../kdiff3-0.9.97/src-QT4
    3a) Create a makefile for kdiff3 by executing:
       qmake kdiff3.pro
    3b) optionally generate XCode-Project (for debugging purposes only) by
    executing:
       qmake -spec macx-xcode kdiff3.pro
    4) Execute:
       make
    5) After the build completes copy kdiff3 from the kdiff3-0.9.97/src-QT4
       directory to:
       /Applications

  Creating and installing the translation messages
    The po directory contains translations from the KDE-translation teams.
    If you use the Qt-only-version of KDiff3, then the installation described
    above won't install translations automatically.
    To create and install the translations:
    1) cd .../kdiff3-0.9.97/po
    2) sh create_qm_files install    (asks for a super user password)
    Just to create the files in the po directory (as needed for the windows
    version):
    2) sh create_qm_files local


(End of KDiff3 with Qt4-instructions)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional hints
----------------

   Start from commandline:
   - Comparing 2 files:     kdiff3 file1 file2
   - Merging 2 files:       kdiff3 file1 file2 -o outputfile
   - Comparing 3 files:     kdiff3 file1 file2 file3
   - Merging 3 files:       kdiff3 file1 file2 file3 -o outputfile
        Note that file1 will be treated as base of file2 and file3.

   If all files have the same name but are in different directories, you can
   reduce typework by specifying the filename only for the first file. E.g.:
   - Comparing 3 files:     kdiff3 dir1/filename dir2 dir3
   (This also works in the open-dialog.)

   If you start without arguments, then a dialog will appear where you can
   select your files via a filebrowser.

   Have fun!
