This file contains some feature-wishes for future KDiff3-versions.

TODO
====
- Verknüpfungsziel für Links relativ anzeigen
- KDiff3-Plugin sollte auch in Dolphin arbeiten
- Alignmenttechnik bei Merge von 3 Dateien wählbar
- Horizontales Scrolling reparieren

- Fix drawing in columns A/B/C-directory window
- Qt4-translation files
- Double clicking into empty area causes crash
- Option window is too big (within KDE). (Scrollable?)
- Windows issues: 
  - Diff-Ext-For-KDiff3 included in the installer 
    - language selection from within KDiff3
- Export to html-format file
- Export to diff-format output (and import?)
- Export to diff3-format output (and import?)
- Use diff-output as input
- Variable width fonts.

  - Use regular expression to ignore certain patterns
  - Start without visible compare widgets. (? what did I mean by that)

- Hardlinks -performance support
- Manual alignment during merge should tell user his data will be lost
- Installer for windows for users.
- "List Only Deltas" causes directory merge to delete files
  (https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1004853&group_id=58666&atid=488548)
- Diff-view for binary files
- Diff-view for pictures

> > What I find weird is that KDiff3 first creates the 3-way merge view (so
> > the window splits in 4 parts), then closes that and reopens in 2-way
> > diff view. I've never seen the binary package do that. Can this be fixed?


- Only show different lines.

- ftp: Abbruch beim Einlesen von Verzeichnis stoppt nicht vollständig

- Projekt-Verwaltung: Die ganze Config-Datei (=Projektdatei) an einen benutzerdefinierten Ort zu legen. (Keine Angabe->Default)
- Bei Combobox-History alle Elemente von (A/B/C/Out) anzeigen.

- Test on empty floppy drive.

-I suppose this has been asked before, but are there any plans to use
 colors for change/insert/delete (i.e. blue = change, green = insert, red
 = delete)?

> I want to compare two revisions of a file (eventually I wanna do this on
> two directory hierarchies of files) and have an output of how many lines
> of code were added, modified, and deleted for each file and overall.
 
> Also, for "Send To" from Windows, it would be nice if I could pick one
> file via Send To, find the second file (if it's in a different
> directory), and click "Send To" again to compare. I.e., when user does
> "Send To", if one instance is already open and waiting for a second
> file, the first instance is used.

 
- kdiff3 does not preserve the permissions of files it overwrites during a 'save' operation.

- Insbesondere Ausführbarkeit "x" und Schreibschutz "w" sollten erhalten bleiben. 

- Under Windows: Shortcut Ctrl-Shift-2 (for select B everywhere doesn't work.)
-                Paste from Clipboard doesn't work.

- Bug: Comment section isn't recognized as nonwhite difference if several lines are between /* and */ on one side.


- Overview-option to show only remaining conflicts.
- Overview bar for merge-window and for directory-window.

- ??? The gutters (kdiff3 have 2 "gutters") fonts and background-foreground colors sholud be configured other
  than the "general" foreground-background colors. Otherwise they are confused with the main dialog.

- Try to autodetect the line-end-style
- Ignore cvs-keywords like $Revision: x.y$

- Undo function in the merge-editor.
- More viewing options for directory widget.

- And one observation. When select Cyrillic charset - it looks like it was
  not saved. When open this dialog again - Latin charset is selected anyway.
- Add options to specify charset.
- Ask before saving to a file that already exists (optionally).
- Don't overwrite existing .orig-file, when saving the second time.

- File Menu: Close (Ctrl-F4): Close current file (check if saved and forget the data)
- Dirview:
   - Multiselections: Changing Operations or applying ops for all selected items.
   - Optionally show size/date for A/B/C
   - Choose what to see (all or only different items)
   - If only different items are visible: copy the others nevertheless to destdir.
   - Warnung wenn Datum in B oder C älter als A ist.
   - Zielverzeichnis nachträglich änderbar
   - Bei Kopie von Remote nach lokal: Auf jeden Fall das modification Datum setzen.
   - Ctrl-Space doesn't work when a file comparison takes place.
   - Option to allow case-insensitive filename-matching.
- Options to show/suppress annoying messages

- What's this-Help.
- Tip of the day.

More Statistics before the merge begins:
- How many files are there?
- How many files are equal/different?
- How many files would be copies/merged/ignored?

- Allow to view and merge CVS-conflict files (and diff3-output) and allow to save output
  with conflicts in diff3 output-format.
  
- Provide configure-rules for systems without KDE. (I need help here.)

- Allow different comment-styles (e.g. via a regexp for comments)

- Possibility to jump to next difference in the same line (for very long lines).

- Allow analysis of unified directory-diff/patch-file.

- LineEdit for Save-Filename
