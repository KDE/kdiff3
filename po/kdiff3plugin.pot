"Using the contextmenu extension:\n"
"For simple comparison of two selected files choose \"Compare\".\n"
"If the other file is somewhere else \"Save\" the first file for later. It "
"will appear in the \"Compare With ...\" submenu. Then use \"Compare With\" "
"on second file.\n"
"For a 3-way merge first \"Save\" the base file, then the branch to merge and "
"choose \"3-way merge with base\" on the other branch which will be used as "
"destination.\n"
"Same also applies to directory comparison and merge."
