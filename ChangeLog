*Rewrite of SourceData::FileData::preprocess now only loops through file contents once.
*Major rework of event handling
  -Move away from event filters where feasible, drop code for events now handled by qt.
  -decentralize handlers
*take advantage of Qt and boost signal/slot pattern to avoid needless nullptr checks.
  -decentralize cut/paste handling
*Introduce LineRef wrapper class
*Add enum types and use existing ones.
  -improves readability of code.
*split out doDirectoryCompare from improveFilenames
  -Principle of least surprise

  c-style memory layout. Much less that this will remain so.
