KDiff3-Readme
=============

Author: Joachim Eibl  (joachim.eibl at gmx.de)
Port to KF5/Qt5 by Michael Reeves (reeves.87@gmail.com)
KDiff3-Version: 1.10.6

Now requires Qt 5.15 or later and KF5 5.50+. Legacy 0.9.98 and earlier builds are not supported.
MacOS X build is 64-bit only unfortunately I can't test build locally. The Konqueror specific plug-in
is not ported and no longer maintained. This plug-in would only apply to KDE before 4.6.

cmake 3.14+ is the targeted cmake version.

cmake is now the only build system supported. KF5/Qt5 was big jump. A lot changed besides just the API.
I am not against a Qt5-only build variant but see no reason to maintain two separate build systems.
At present KF5 is my focus.

Known Issues:
*Binary comparison has been temporarily disabled due to stability issues.
*Network comparison operation via non file urls may fail for some configurations. This is under investigation.

Binaries can be downloaded at https://download.kde.org/stable/kdiff3/?C=M;O=D

Bugs can be reported at https://bugs.kde.org

The original pre KF5/Qt5 Readme follows old build instructions have been removed to avoid confusion:

KDiff3 runs best on KDE but can be built without it, depending only on Qt-libs.
These are available for Un*x, Windows, Mac.
Thus there are many setup possibilities to consider.

Additional hints
----------------

   Start from commandline:
   - Comparing 2 files:     kdiff3 file1 file2
   - Merging 2 files:       kdiff3 file1 file2 -o outputfile
   - Comparing 3 files:     kdiff3 file1 file2 file3
   - Merging 3 files:       kdiff3 file1 file2 file3 -o outputfile
        Note that file1 will be treated as base of file2 and file3.

   If all files have the same name but are in different directories, you can
   reduce typework by specifying the filename only for the first file. E.g.:
   - Comparing 3 files:     kdiff3 dir1/filename dir2 dir3
   (This also works in the open-dialog.)

   If you start without arguments, then a dialog will appear where you can
   select your files via a filebrowser.

   For more documentation, see the help-menu or the subdirectory doc.

   Have fun!
